As you may have known, I have a cat character with similar name, however I am me as myself, while my cat character is as itself. Not the same entity. Qatoqat is also my brand name / trademark. I made this website as a portfolio and to keep records and notes through my art journey. I started learning digital drawing on 1st of April 2015 and have been stable since 2019. I'd say it's worth to learn and to be able to interpret thoughts visually. Art / Tools of trade I use Paint Tool SAI 2 for almost all of my art; digital drawing and pixel art. As of today (29th of June 2022), SAI2 is still in Preview release. Those who can afford SAI2 licence, I totally recommend supporting the developer by purchasing it. Making software and programs for artists is pretty difficult Anyways, here are list of tools I'm using for art: Hardware Mouse - Early days, and still using for pixel art; easy to target Tablet - Line art and coloring; turn on pressure to control brush size Touchpad - Pixel art; it's easier to target within small distances Keyboard - Keyboard shortcut; saves wrist and brain cells for later Software Paint Tool SAI 2; as mentioned before ezGIF.com ; GIF making and editing FireAlpaca; GIF animation and chromatic aberration Paint.NET; Resizing, cropping, and saving image to an optimized format Programming / App development I can develop apps for desktop, mobile and web. Mainly, I do coding in Rust and Python, but I can also do in other languages! Other stuff I have been involved with are making discord bots and game development.
